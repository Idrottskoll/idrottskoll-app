                            Every year, I took a holiday. I went to Florence,
                            this cafe on the banks of the Arno. Every fine
                            evening, I would sit there and order a Fernet
                            Branca. I had this fantasy, that I would look across
                            the tables and I would see you there with a wife
                            maybe a couple of kids. You wouldn't say anything to
                            me, nor me to you. But we would both know that
                            you've made it, that you were happy. I never wanted
                            you to come back to Gotham. I always knew there was
                            nothing here for you except pain and tragedy and I
                            wanted something more for you than that. I still do.
